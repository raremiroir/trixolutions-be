                     almost anyone can learn to become a team player. I believe that.<br/>
                     <br/>
                     Having said that, some people are better at teamwork than others. 
                     These are the kind of people who add immediate value in a team 
                     environment and require much less coaching and management to 
                     contribute in a meaningful way.<br/>
                     <br/>
                     So, there are two obvious questions. What do these people look like? 
                     And how do we find them? As it turns out, they have three qualities or 
                     virtues in common: they are humble, hungry and smart.`,
            second: `Before I explain each of those virtues, let me explain how this theory 
                     came about. <br/>
                     Like so many of my ideas, this one surfaced as a result of my work with 
                     clients over the past twenty years.<br/>
                     Whenever I worked with CEOs and their leadership teams to identify core 
                     values, I often was asked about the values of my own firm, The Table Group. 
                     When we revealed our three values, many of our clients would ask us if they 
                     could adopt those values for themselves.<br/>
                     <br/>
                     Of course, we would say ‘no,’ explaining that they needed to come up with 
                     concepts that reflected their unique history and culture. We were a company 
                     oriented around teamwork and known for The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, so 
                     the values of humble, hungry and smart made sense for us. What we failed to 
                     realise was that our clients, almost all of whom were committed to the idea 
                     of teamwork, were drawn to our values because those were the building blocks 
                     of real team players. Once we realised this, the idea for this book was born.`

                        disproportionate amount of attention, are dangerous for a team.<br/>
                        Having said that, humble team players are not afraid to honestly acknowledge

                        team succeed.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Hungry employees almost never have to be pushed by a manager

                           This type knows how to present himself or herself as a well-intentioned

                           <em>How do you go about hiring ideal team players?</em> It’s mostly about

                        reinforce what is true and important. They always err on the side of saying too much, rather 
                        than too little.<br/>

                        six critical questions are reinforced repeatedly using simple human systems.<br/>
                        That means any process that involves people, from hiring and firing to performance 
                        management and decision-making, is designed in a custom way to intentionally support 
                        and emphasise the uniqueness of the organisation.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        In addition to these four steps, it is essential that a healthy organisation gets 
                        better at the one activity that underpins everything it does: meetings. Yes, meetings. <br/>
                        Without making a few simple but fundamental changes to the way meetings happen, a healthy 
                        organisation will struggle to maintain what it has worked hard to build.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Can a healthy organisation fail?<br/>
                        Yes. But it almost never happens. Really. When politics, ambiguity, dysfunction and 
                        confusion are reduced to a minimum, people are empowered to design products, serve 
                        customers, solve problems and help one another in ways that unhealthy organisations can 
                        only dream about.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Healthy organisations recover from setbacks, attract the best people, repel the 
                        others and create opportunities that they couldn’t have expected.<br/>
                        At the end of the day, at the end of the quarter, employees are happier, the 
                        bottom line is stronger, and executives are at peace because they know they’ve 
                        fulfilled their most important responsibility of all: creating an environment of success.`,
