                           and pleasure and they end up in jobs and projects that <strong>tire and demotivate</strong> them, 
                           which reflects on 2 aspects::<br/><br/>
                           <ul><li>Firstly, it causes people to <strong>lose their zelfvertrouwen self-confidence 
                           and enjoyment of life</strong>, which is not only a personal problem, but also a social and even a societal one.</li>
                           <li>Secondly, organizations and teams that do not capitalize on the personal intrinsic capabilities 
                           of their team members <strong>will never use and develop the full potential of their employees.</strong>.

                           satisfaction of those employees is low.</li></ul><br/>
                           The solution lies in everyone (employees, managers, students…) discovering their 
                           <strong>intrinsic working abilities</strong> and therefore also the abilities they 
                           do not naturally possess (which will therefore always cost energy), in order to
